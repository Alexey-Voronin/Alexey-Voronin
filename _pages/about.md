I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Mathematics Department at
Sandia National Laboratories, specializing in scalable numerical solvers for
complex engineering and physics problems. My expertise is in developing
multilevel methods that enhance the performance of algorithms solving linear and
nonlinear partial differential equations. These techniques have broad
applications in fields like graph partitioning, optimization, and machine
learning.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. With over eight years of experience in scientific computing
and numerical modeling, my career also includes three years as a
software engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. There, I enhanced
multiphysics simulation codes by applying my knowledge in GPU
computing, modern HPC architectures, multigrid methods, and PDEs.
