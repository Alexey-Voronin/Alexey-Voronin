I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, with over eight years of experience in scientific computing
and numerical modeling. My research focuses on creating scalable numerical
solvers for complex engineering and physics problems. I specialize in developing
multilevel methods that improve the performance of algorithms solving linear and
nonlinear partial differential equations. These methods have applications in
various fields, including graph partitioning, optimization, and high-performance
computing.

Before and during my PhD, I worked as a software engineer at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and as an intern at Sandia National Laboratories. There, I
enhanced multiphysics simulation codes by applying my knowledge in GPU
computing, modern HPC architectures, multigrid methods, and PDEs. My goal is to
combine computational innovation with practical applications, and I am keen to
collaborate with teams that share this ambition.
