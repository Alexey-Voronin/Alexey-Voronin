With over eight years of experience in scientific computing and numerical
modeling, I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, where I conduct cutting-edge research on scalable numerical
solvers for coupled physics and engineering applications. My work involves
developing and implementing novel multilevel methods that enhance the robustness
and efficiency of numerical algorithms for (non-)linear PDEs and complex linear
systems, as well as applying them to diverse domains such as graph partitioning,
optimization, and high-performance computing (HPC).

Prior to and during my PhD, I have also gained valuable practical experience as
a software engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a student
intern at Sandia National Laboratories, where I have contributed to the
optimization and advancement of several multiphysics simulation codes,
leveraging my expertise in CUDA, emerging HPC architectures, algebraic multigrid
methods, and PDEs. I am passionate about bridging the gap between computational
innovation and real-world applications, and I am eager to join teams and
projects that share this vision.
